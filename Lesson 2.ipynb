An experiment is when these observations are tested. Experiments include a test group and a control group, where there is some variable that is changed in the two groups. Inorder for an experiment to be useful the two groups should be the exact same or as close as possible with the only difference being the tested variable. \n",

There are still many variables in the two cities but trying to eliminate everything but the one variable is the way to create the best experiment. "
